This is a diagram showing a wheeled vehicle class and it's subclasses.

_Note_ The line to between the Wheeled Vehicle class and the Moving interface is supposed to be a dashed line with an open arrow at the top of it(realization/implementation line). It is currently showing up as a solid line in StarUML.
